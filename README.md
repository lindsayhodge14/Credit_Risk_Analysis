# Credit_Risk_Analysis
Module 17 Challenge: Machine Learning

## Overview
For this challenge, Jill asked us to assess individuals' credit card riskby considering their loan payment history/status. We used machine learning models to evaluate the individuals and make determinations on their credit card risk. 

* I was not able to get my code to work for Deliverable 3, but I don't know why.
